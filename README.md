Task: CLOUD MONITORING AND ALERTS

Overview of the Project
TASK: SET UP MONITORING FOR A CLOUD BASED APPLICATION USING AWS CLOUDWATCH.

Task Highlights

1.Enabled AWS CloudWatch for Monitoring

Activated CloudWatch monitoring for AWS services like EC2.

Installed and configured the CloudWatch Agent to collect system logs and performance data.

Ensured continuous tracking of application resource usage and health metrics.

2.Configured System & Custom Metrics

Monitored default AWS metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption and network traffic.

Added custom application-specific metrics like database query response time and error rates.

Ensured accurate data collection for better performance analysis and troubleshooting.

3.Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Performance Issues

Defined alarms for high CPU usage.

Configured automatic actions, such as scaling resources or restarting services when thresholds were exceeded.

4.Integrated SNS for Real-Time Alerts

Linked CloudWatch Alarms to Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) for instant notifications.

Configured alerts to be sent via email for automated response actions.

Ensured rapid response to potential issues by key team members.

5.Built a CloudWatch Dashboard for Visualization

Created a custom CloudWatch dashboard to display real-time and historical data.

Included widgets for CPU usage, memory utilization, network latency.

Provided a centralized monitoring view to simplify troubleshooting.

6.Tested & Validated the Monitoring Setup

Simulated high CPU load, application failures, and traffic spikes to verify alert accuracy.

Ensured alerts were triggered correctly and sent to the right recipients.

Fine-tuned metrics, thresholds, and dashboards for optimal performance monitoring.

Key Achievements

1.Successful AWS CloudWatch Integration

Enabled real-time monitoring of application performance by integrating AWS CloudWatch with cloud-based resources.

Configured CloudWatch to automatically collect critical system metrics such as CPU, memory, network traffic.

2.Proactive Performance Management

Established a structured monitoring approach using both system and custom metrics for better insights.

Ensured real-time tracking of essential metrics like CPU utilization, memory consumptions.

3.Automated Issue Detection & Alerts

Created CloudWatch Alarms with defined thresholds to detect and alert on performance issues.

Integrated Amazon SNS to send real-time notifications for potential system failures.

4.Real-Time Notifications with SNS

Configured Amazon SNS topics to trigger notifications when CloudWatch Alarms detect anomalies.

Verified email and SMS notifications by simulating performance breaches and testing alert responses.

5.Centralized Monitoring with Dashboards

Designed a custom CloudWatch Dashboard to visualize key application and infrastructure metrics.

Configured graphical widgets for a clearer view of CPU, memory, network usage, and system errors.

6.Efficient Troubleshooting & Optimization

Fine-tuned alarm thresholds to reduce false positives and enhance monitoring accuracy.

Monitored CloudWatch logs and historical data to optimize system performance and cost efficiency.
